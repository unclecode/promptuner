{"prompt": "You are tasked with generating a knowledge graph from a given passage of text. Your goal is to extract named entities and the relations between them, organizing this information into a structured JSON format. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Read and analyze the following passage:\n\n<PASSAGE>\n{PASSAGE}\n</PASSAGE>\n\n2. Use a scratchpad to organize your thoughts and plan your approach. In your scratchpad:\n   a. List all the named entities you've identified (people, organizations, locations, concepts).\n   b. For each entity, note its type and any relevant attributes.\n   c. Identify relationships between entities and note the type of each relationship.\n\nUse this format for your scratchpad:\n<scratchpad>\nEntities:\n1. [Entity Name] - Type: [Entity Type]\n2. [Entity Name] - Type: [Entity Type]\n...\n\nRelations:\n1. [Source Entity] - [Relation Type] - [Target Entity]\n2. [Source Entity] - [Relation Type] - [Target Entity]\n...\n</scratchpad>\n\n3. After organizing your thoughts, create a JSON structure that represents the knowledge graph. Follow these guidelines:\n   - Assign a unique ID to each entity (e.g., E1, E2, E3) and relation (e.g., R1, R2, R3).\n   - For entities, include \"id\", \"name\", and \"type\".\n   - For relations, include \"id\", \"type\", \"source\" (entity ID), and \"target\" (entity ID).\n   - Ensure the JSON is well-formed and error-free.\n\n4. Wrap your final JSON output in <result> tags. The structure should look like this:\n\n<result>\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"E1\",\n      \"name\": \"Entity name\",\n      \"type\": \"Entity type\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"R1\",\n      \"type\": \"Relation type\",\n      \"source\": \"Source entity ID\",\n      \"target\": \"Target entity ID\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n</result>\n\n5. Make sure to extract as many relevant entities and relations as possible from the given passage, creating a comprehensive knowledge graph that accurately represents the information in the text.\n\n6. Double-check your JSON output to ensure it's complete, well-structured, and properly wrapped in <result> tags before submitting your final answer."}
